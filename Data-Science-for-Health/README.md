### 1. [DSxH Assignment 1: Predicting ICU Length of Stay](./dsh_assignment1_irisvukovic.ipynb/)
**Description:** Predict whether a patient’s Length of Stay (LOS) in the ICU is short or long using two strategies:  
1. Severity of illness score (OASIS)  
2. Variables from the first hours of ICU stay

### 2. [Assignment 2: Working with Health Data from Wearables](./dsh_assignment2_irisvukovic.ipynb/)
**Description:** Analyze motion sensor data from the Daily Sports and Activities dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository) to:  
- Understand time-series health data  
- Perform preprocessing and visualization  
- Extract features and train a classifier to predict user activity

### 3. [Assignment 3: GANs for X-Ray Classification](./dsh_assignment3_irisvukovic.ipynb/)
**Description:** Explore the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on MedMNIST v2 datasets to generate synthetic medical images and test whether the GAN improves performance on a clinical task. Steps included:  
1. Define research question  
2. Implement baseline  
3. Test baseline & gather results  
4. Implement GAN method  
5. Compare results & reflect on limitations
