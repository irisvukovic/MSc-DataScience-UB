### 3. [Assignment 3: GANs for X-Ray Classification](./assignment3/)
**Description:** Explore the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on MedMNIST v2 datasets to generate synthetic medical images and test whether the GAN improves performance on a clinical task. Steps included:  
1. Define research question  
2. Implement baseline  
3. Test baseline & gather results  
4. Implement GAN method  
5. Compare results & reflect on limitations
