# Complex Networks

This course explores the underlying structures, dynamics, and interactions of real, complex networks. 

## Projects / Assignments

### 1. [Exploring the Call Network](./Complex-Networks-Study_1.ipynb)
For the first assignment, we explored a single layer of the multi-layer social network from the Copenhagen Networks Study — specifically, **call interactions** between 706 university students.  
We analyzed the network at both the **macro** (global) and **micro** (node-level) scales, examining metrics such as degree distributions, centrality measures, and connectivity patterns.  


### 2. [Bluetooth Proximity Network Analysis](./Complex-Networks-Study_2.ipynb)
For the second assignment, we focused on the **Bluetooth proximity layer** to analyze community structure and network dynamics.  
We studied clusters, bridge nodes, and potential paths for disease spread or information flow within the network. The interactive HTML version contains visualizations and results, while the notebook contains the underlying code.
